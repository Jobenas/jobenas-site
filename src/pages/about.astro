	<p>
		I’m Jorge Benavides Aspiazu (jobenas), an electrical engineer focused on end-to-end IoT and connected systems.
	</p>

	<p>
		Most of my work sits at the boundary between constrained devices and production software: firmware architecture, ingestion pipelines, data modeling, and the operational trade-offs that show up after deployment.
	</p>

	<p>
		This site is where I write down patterns that hold up in real systems—especially when requirements evolve and the device mix becomes heterogeneous.
	</p>

	<p>
		I also work with teams facing production issues at the boundary between devices, networks, and cloud systems.
