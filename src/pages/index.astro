			<h1>Hi, I’m Jorge</h1>

			<p>
				I work across the full stack of connected systems, particularly IoT — from
				embedded firmware and hardware constraints to LPWAN and satellite networks,
				data ingestion, and cloud backends.
			</p>

			<p>
				This site is a notebook of engineering problems that only show up once systems
				grow — especially at the boundaries between devices, networks, and the cloud —
				and the trade-offs that survive real production use.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Start here:</strong>
				<a href="/blog/multi-network-considerations-for-scaling-iot-applications/">
				Multi-network considerations for scaling IoT applications
				</a>
			</p>

			<p>
				I work with teams on existing IoT systems — architecture reviews, multi-network
				integrations, and diagnosing hard-to-debug production issues.
			</p>

			<p>
				Most engagements start as focused technical work and often expand into broader
				system design or implementation support as complexity grows.
			</p>

			<p>
				Typical areas I work on include:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Embedded and hardware-constrained systems</li>
				<li>LPWAN and satellite network integrations</li>
				<li>Device lifecycle, presence, and control-plane design</li>
				<li>Data ingestion pipelines and production observability</li>
			</ul>
