			<h1>Hi I'm Jorge</h1>

			<p>
				I work across the full stack of connected systems, particularly IoT, 
				from embedded firmware and hardware constraints to LPWAN and satellite networks,
				data ingestion, and cloud backends.
			</p>

			<p>
				This site is a notebook of engineering problems that only show up once systems grow,
				especially at the boundaries between devices, networks, and the cloud,
				and the trade-offs that survive real production use.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Start here:</strong>
				<a href="/blog/multi-network-considerations/">Multi-network considerations for scaling IoT applications</a>
			</p>

			<p>
				<em>
					I also occasionally consult on existing IoT systems —
					architecture reviews, multi-network integrations, and hard-to-debug production issues.
